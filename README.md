# Credit Card Fraud Data Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains an analysis of credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activities. The dataset used for this analysis covers a period of three months and includes a target column of is_fraud.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on credit card transactions, including various features such as transaction amount, merchant information, and timestamp.
## Analysis Highlights

In this analysis, we performed various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques to gain insights into the credit card transaction data. Some of the key highlights of our analysis include:

- **Data Exploration:** We explored the dataset to understand its structure, the distribution of features, and basic statistics.

- **Fraud Detection:** We focused on identifying patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions within the dataset.

- **Data Visualization:** We created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize relationships between different features and their correlation with fraud.

- **Feature Engineering:** We may have engineered new features or preprocessed existing ones to improve model performance.

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis was conducted using the following tools and technologies:

- **Jupyter IDE:** We used Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis and visualization.

- **Python:** Python was the primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
